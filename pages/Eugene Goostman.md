- **Eugene Goostman** is a [chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot) that some regard as having passed the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test), a test of a computer's ability to communicate indistinguishably from a human. Developed in [Saint Petersburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg) in 2001 by a group of three programmers, the Russian-born Vladimir Veselov, Ukrainian-born Eugene Demchenko, and Russian-born Sergey Ulasen,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman#cite_note-zdnet-eugenepass-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman#cite_note-uor-success-2) Goostman is portrayed as a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy—characteristics that are intended to induce forgiveness in those with whom it interacts for its grammatical errors and lack of general knowledge.
