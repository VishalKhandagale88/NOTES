- **Eugene Goostman** is a **chatbot** that some regard as having passed the [[Turing test]], a test of a computer's ability to communicate indistinguishably from a human. Developed in **Saint Petersburg** in 2001 by a group of three programmers, the Russian-born Vladimir Veselov, Ukrainian-born Eugene Demchenko, and Russian-born Sergey Ulasen Goostman is portrayed as a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy—characteristics that are intended to induce forgiveness in those with whom it interacts for its grammatical errors and lack of general knowledge.
