  | Weak AI refers to AI systems that are designed and trained for a specific task or a narrow set of tasks. | Strong AI, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), refers to AI systems with human-level intelligence and understanding. |
  | These AI systems are not generally intelligent; they excel in performing a predefined task but lack true understanding or consciousness. | These AI systems have the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human being can do, adapt to different domains, and possess a form of consciousness or self-awareness. |
  | Examples of weak AI include virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation algorithms used by streaming services, and chatbots that are designed for specific customer service tasks. | Achieving Strong AI is a long-term goal of AI research and would require the development of AI systems that can reason, learn, understand, and adapt across a wide range of tasks and contexts. |
  | Weak AI is highly specialized and does not possess human-like cognitive abilities or general problem-solving capabilities beyond its narrow domain. | Strong AI is currently a theoretical concept, and no AI system has reached this level of general intelligence |
- There is no clear definition of this term called [[Intelligence]]. One can argue that intelligence is connected with [[abstract thinking]] or
