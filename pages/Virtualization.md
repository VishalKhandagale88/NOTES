- ðŸ‘‰ **Virtualization means making one real computer act like many small pretend computers.**
- ### Example in real life:
- Imagine you have **one big house** (a powerful computer).
- You put **walls inside it** and divide it into many **small apartments** (virtual machines).
- Each family (user or program) thinks it has its **own house** (its own computer), but actually, theyâ€™re all sharing the **same big house** (the real computer).
  
  So basically:
- **Without virtualization** â†’ One computer runs one operating system.
- **With virtualization** â†’ One computer can run many operating systems at the same time.
  
  Do you want me to also show you a **simple picture/diagram** to make it clearer?
