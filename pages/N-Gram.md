- Got it 👍 Let me break it down simply, no tech jargon.

- ### Imagine you’re reading a book 📖
  
  When you see the sentence:
  
  **“I want to drink a …”**
  
  your brain probably guesses the next word is **“coffee”** or **“tea”** — not **“car”** or **“building.”**
  
  That’s basically what an **N-Gram model** does.
  
  ---
- ### What’s an N-Gram?
- “N” just means **how many words you look at together**.
- A **1-gram (unigram)** looks at just 1 word at a time.
- A **2-gram (bigram)** looks at pairs of words, like “drink coffee” or “good morning.”
- A **3-gram (trigram)** looks at triples, like “I love pizza.”

- ### How the model works
  
  It’s like a **predictive text keyboard on your phone**.
- It looks at the last few words you typed.
- It remembers common word patterns from past texts/books.
- Then it guesses the next word based on those patterns.
  
  So if the model has seen “New York” many times, it knows “York” often follows “New.”

- ### Everyday Example 🌟
- **Typing on your phone:** Suggestions like “How are…” → “you”
- **Search engines:** When you type “best pizza in…” it suggests “New York.”
- **Speech recognition:** Helps predict what word you probably said.

  👉 In short: An **N-Gram model is like a smart word-guessing game** that uses the last few words to predict the next one.
