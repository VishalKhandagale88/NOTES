- research discovery ideas Bottom-up and Top-down approached
- ### **Example 1: Medicine / Healthcare**
- **Bottom-up**: Doctors notice that a group of patients taking a certain plant-based tea for relaxation also report lower blood pressure. They didn’t start with a theory; the discovery *emerged* from observations. Later, scientists study the tea and find it contains compounds that reduce blood pressure.
- **Top-down**: A researcher believes that "Compound A lowers blood pressure" and designs an experiment to test only that idea.

- ### **Example 2: Technology / AI**
- **Bottom-up**: Machine learning: instead of telling the computer exact rules, you give it tons of data (like thousands of cat photos). The system discovers patterns (fur, whiskers, ears) and *learns* what a cat looks like. No fixed theory was given; knowledge emerged.
- **Top-down**: Writing a program with specific rules: “if it has whiskers and pointy ears, then it’s a cat.”

- ### **Example 3: Business / Innovation**
- **Bottom-up**: A company collects customer feedback from thousands of app users. They notice many people are using a feature in a creative way the designers didn’t expect. That sparks an idea for a brand-new product.
- **Top-down**: A company’s executives decide "We will create an app for X" based on strategy first, then test it with users.

- Bottom-up= discoveries come from observations, data, and patterns you find
- Top-down= discoveries come from theories or plans you already have
